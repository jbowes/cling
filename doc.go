/*
Package cling provides a clear and obvious error wrapping API for Go 2/1.13+
error values.

Errors created by this package support the Go 2 proposal for error values:
	https://golang.org/design/29934-error-values
Most functionality in this package is available through the golang.org/x/xerrors
package, or in errors itself after Go 1.13. However, this package provides an
API that may be more familiar and comfortable to users of other error packages,
like pkg/errors.
